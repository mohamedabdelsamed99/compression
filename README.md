# compression
The Compression App is a Flutter-based program designed to help users compress text using three different algorithms:
Huffman, Run-Length Encoding (RLE), and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW). 
Each part of the app focuses on one algorithm, making it simple to analyze and calculate text compression results effortlessly.

# Features

*Huffman Compression: Generate Huffman codes, view compressed binary text, and analyze compression efficiency.

* RLE Compression: Encode repetitive sequences, compute compression ratios, and explore sequence information.

* LZW Compression: Efficiently compress input text using the LZW technique.

* Input validation for each algorithm to ensure meaningful results.

# App Structure

* Page: Navigate to different compression algorithms.

* Huffman Compression Page: Compresses input text using Huffman coding and displays codes, compressed text, sizes, and compression ratio.

* RLE Compression Page: Encodes input text, calculates different terms and compression ratio, and handles logs for maximum repeat counts.

* LZW Compression Page: (To be implemented).
